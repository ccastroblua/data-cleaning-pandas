# W2 Project - Data cleaning & wrangling

The goal of this project is to analize the correlation between shark attacks and different variables.

## Questions:

### First part:
- Does shark attacks are increasing or decreasing YoY?

### Second part:
- What chance do we have to die by a shark attack?
- Is there any activity that people perform that produce more shark attacks?
- Is there any correlation between activity, shark species and attack mortality rate?

### This part (WORK IN PROGRESS):

- Which are the top 5 countries in shark attacks?
- Which are the months with more attacks in the year?
- Is there any correlation between winter/summer/spring/autumn season and shark attacks?
- Is there any region with high shark attacks rate?

## Files srtructure:

- "src" folder with a python file (cleaning_utils.py): files with functions to used in both jupyter notebook files.
- Cleaning Jupyter Notebook file (clean.ipynb): Project cleaning stage.
- Analysis Jupyter Notebook file (analysis.ipynb): Project analysis stage.
- Raw shark attacks dataset - csv format (attacks.csv)
- Clean shark attacs dataset - csv format (attacks_limpio.csv)

## Library used:
